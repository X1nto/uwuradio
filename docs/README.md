# uwu-radio technical documentation

These docs detail how uwu radio works technically.

This serves three purposes:
 1. Allow other uwu members to contribute to uwu radio more easily
 2. Help me figure out how its going to work without an implementation
 3. As a learning resource for SignalR, ASP.NET Core, and multiple JS things

## Additional notes:

This code is BSD-3 - you must credit if you use it.
I will try to keep the code clean and docs up to date.

Thanks, Yellowsink.
